## Projects

### Wells Fargo Interpretable Machine Learning for Mortgage Default Prediction <a name="Default"></a>

- **Overview**:  
  The mortgage market plays a crucial role in financial markets. This project develops a predictive model for mortgage default over the next 24 months, focusing on interpretability, accuracy, and risk management. Key objectives include:
  - Enhancing the stability of mortgage-backed securities.
  - Adapting to diverse economic conditions, including crises like COVID-19.
  - Integrating static, dynamic, and macroeconomic variables for robust predictions.

- **Data**:
  - **Source**: Freddie Mac single-family home loans, from 2000 to Q2 2023.
  - **Content**: Origination and performance data for 30-year fixed-rate mortgages.
  - **Macroeconomic Variables**: Housing price index, inflation rate, and unemployment rate.

- **Preprocessing and Sampling Techniques**:
  - [Code: Preprocessing Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/seulgi2213/Profile/blob/main/Preprocessing_PySpark.ipynb)
  - **Data Cleaning**:
    - Scope: 64 variables and over 2.4 billion rows, processed with PySpark on GWU‚Äôs High Power Computing system.
    - Key Steps:
      - Handling Missing Data: Removed columns with over 95% null values.
      - Merging Datasets: Combined Performance and Origination datasets on `LOAN SEQUENCE NUMBER` to create a complete loan lifecycle view.
      - ELTV Calculation: Estimated Loan-to-Value (ELTV) ratio calculated as the ratio of current unpaid balance to adjusted housing price, accounting for housing price index changes.
  - **Variable Selection**:
    - Target Variable: Probability of default.
    - Input Variables:  
      - Static Variables: Origination Credit Score, Original Interest Rate, Property Type, Loan Purpose, etc.
      - Dynamic Variables: Current Unpaid Balance, Loan Delinquency Status, Loan Age, ELTV.
      - Macroeconomic Variables: Current Interest Rate, Unemployment Rate, Inflation Rate, House Price Index (nationally used for null values at the state level).
  - **Sampling Strategy**: Selected loans based on `CURRENT LOAN DELINQUENCY STATUS`, with 3,000 loans per year, including 350 defaults and 350 non-defaults per quarter.

- **Creating the Stacked Dataset for Time-Series Analysis**:
  - [Code: Stacked Dataset Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/seulgi2213/Profile/blob/main/Stacked%20Time%20Series%20Dataframe.ipynb)
  - Overview of Time Series Horizon: The predictive loan default model uses a paneled time series approach, where each loan‚Äôs last row is duplicated 24 times for long-term forecasting.

- **XGBoost Modeling in PiML**:
  - [Code: Modeling Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/seulgi2213/Profile/blob/main/Modeling%20with%20XGBoost%20in%20PiML.ipynb)
  - **Model Accuracy**: Key metrics for the XGB2_v2 model include test AUC of 0.7287 and test F1-score of 0.6416.

- **Visualizations**:
  - Residual Box Plot and Predicted vs. Actual Default Rate.

### Bikeshare Optimization <a name="ML1"></a>

- **Purpose**:  
  This project aims to enhance bikeshare operation efficiency by accurately predicting pickup and dropoff demand, improving resource allocation, reducing unmet demand, and maximizing profitability. Models evaluated include:
  - **Linear Regression**
  - **Lasso Regression**
  - **Ridge Regression**
  - **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**
  - **Elastic Net Regression**

- **Model Development**:
  - **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
    - Data Integration: Combined bikeshare usage data with weather data to understand how weather affects bikeshare demand.
    - Feature Selection: Selected variables including `tempmax`, `feelslikemax`, `precipcover`, `humidity`, and `windspeed`.
  - **Predictive Modeling**: Models trained to predict pickup and dropoff counts using the selected weather features.
  - **Evaluation Metrics**: R-Squared and Mean Squared Error (MSE) were used to evaluate each model's performance.

- **Results**:
  - **Pickup Accuracy**: Linear Regression achieved the highest R-squared of 0.34.
  - **Dropoff Accuracy**: Lasso Regression achieved the highest R-squared of 0.344.
  - **Cost and Quality Strategies**:
    - Cost Strategy: Linear Regression minimized the cost of unmet demand.
    - Quality Strategy: Linear Regression provided the highest quality of service alignment.

- **Data Preprocessing**:
  - **Data Cleaning**: No missing values were found.
  - **Feature Engineering**: Converted categorical variables to numerical, selected key features for model training.

- **Modeling**:
  - **Models Evaluated**:
    - Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, XGBoost.
  - **Revenue Prediction Assumptions**:
    - Investment Return: 15% quarterly return on invested customer funds.
    - Interest Rate on Savings: 3% annual interest, increased to 5% for at-risk customers.

- **Results**:
  - **Model Performance**: Random Forest and XGBoost emerged as the top models.
  - **Decision Performance Evaluation**:
    - Pre-Model Revenue: $11.43 million.
